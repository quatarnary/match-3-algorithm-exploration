init

example board
|r c| 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | B | R | Y | B | B |
| 1 | Y | R | G | G | R |
| 2 | G | G | B | R | Y |
| 3 | Y | Y | R | B | R |
| 4 | B | R | B | G | B |

## or instead of Bitmask approach let's go with 2D array with floating point storage...

1 for vertical, .1 for horizontal
- the existing color is 1.1
- for each vertical same consecutive color +1
- for each horizontal same consecutive color +.1

Or instead of floats we can also go with int...
- at first it seemed that 2 digits may not be enough..
- however there should be a case where 9+ horizontal hit, regardless of the grid size...
  - well I definitely hope so lol

for blue example float storage 
|r c|  0  |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |
|---|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| 0 | 1.1 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 1.2 | 1.1 |
| 1 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| 2 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 1.1 | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| 3 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 1.1 | 0.0 |
| 4 | 1.1 | 0.0 | 1.1 | 0.0 | 1.1 |

for green example float storage 
|r c|  0  |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |
|---|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| 0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| 1 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 1.2 | 1.1 | 0.0 |
| 2 | 1.2 | 1.1 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| 3 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| 4 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 1.1 | 0.0 |

### now the questions are...
-  how to detect T, L square matches?
-  how to highlight a possible move?

#### totally unrelated question... How is this different that brute force checking?.. I mean I'm already looking at every possible tile...
But there are issues with both approaches.. Like if I go with bitwise and let's say I want to look at 'T' shape match, I would need the all possible 3x3 subset of 5x5 grid...
I mean yeah it could be optimized with something like "only check the most matched subsets" however will be faster than just brute forcing?
_~~ Please let me do backend üôè I don't like the Quake III's "evil flaoting point bit hack".. because I totally agree with the next comment of that code...~~_

for template example float storage 
|r c|  0  |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |
|---|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| 0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| 1 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| 2 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| 3 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| 4 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 |

## Bitmask approach

Example Board Bitmask:
|r c| 0    | 1    | 2    | 3    | 4    |
|---|------|------|------|------|------|
| 0 | 0001 | 0010 | 0100 | 0001 | 0001 |
| 1 | 0100 | 0010 | 1000 | 1000 | 0010 |
| 2 | 1000 | 1000 | 0001 | 0010 | 0100 |
| 3 | 0100 | 0100 | 0010 | 0001 | 0010 |
| 4 | 0001 | 0010 | 0001 | 1000 | 0001 |

```
int wholeGrid = 0b 0001 0010 0100 0001 0001 0100 0010 1000 1000 0010 1000 1000 0001 0010 0100 0100 0100 0010 0001 0010 0001 0010 0001 1000 0001
```

I know this is not how it should look but gotta start from somewhere

Example Match Patterns:

horizontal 3:
| b | b | b | b | b |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 |

T shape:
| b | b | b |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 |
